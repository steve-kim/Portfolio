4) Bootloader
-------------
--) LogicLoader 2.5.3 or higher is required
--) Tested with 2.5.3


5) Known Issues
---------------
--) The Windows CE operating system supports a maximum physical memory of 512MB. The 
    DM37 processor has 160MB of register space which must be allocated in the same 512MB 
    window. As a result, the 512MB RAM configuration has 352MB of User accessible RAM. 

--) A pop sound may be heard at the end of an audio file.
   (Jira # OMAP3WCE600-341)

--) Audio out is noisy/static for a few seconds after going to suspend and resume.
    Make sure audio is stopped before going into suspend.
   (Jira # DM3730WCE-83)
    
--) KITL Auto Negotiation
    KITL will fail at connecting to a network that does not support auto 
    negotiation. In current release, auto negotiation must be available for KITL
    to work.
   (Jira # OMAP3WCE600-444)

--) SDIO multi-block data transfers are limited to 2 blocks/transfer (silicon bug).
   (Jira # OMAP3WCE600-445)

--) SDIO "I/O mode on" does not reliably work.
   (Jira # OMAP3WCE600-446)

--) SDIO Windows CETK test does not complete and results in the device 
    disconnecting.
   (Jira # OMAP3WCE600-447)

--) Debug binary may not return to operation after entering low-power mode.
    Upon entering low-power mode or being suspended when using the debug binary
    module, the system may not recover to full operation. The CE screen may or 
    may not return, and if the CE screen does return it may or may not operate 
    normally. This behavior has not been observed on the release binary.
    (Jira # OMAP3WCE600-448)

--) Debug tools and debugging via ActiveSync are not supported. 
    Cause:
     Windows CE 6.0 has no support for Cortex-A8 ARMv7-A; therefore, it falls 
     back to using ARMv4 instead. However, the built-in Microsoft Platform 
     Builder CE Debug Tools support the ARMv4i architecture only. 
    Workaround:
     Copy 
      x:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Windows CE Tools\Platman\
         target\wce600\armV4i 
     into 
      x:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Windows CE Tools\Platman\
         target\wce600\armV4
    For further information, please refer to the following URL:
    http://nicolasbesson.blogspot.com/2007/06/remote-tools-arm-processor-and-windows.html

--) SPI Test will fail on the first pass on SPI1 interface if Bluetooth is 
    configured in the build. It will pass on the second attempt. If Bluetooth is
    not configured, the test should pass on the first attempt. 
   (Jira # OMAP3WCE600-449) (see also OMAP3WCE600-154)

--) Bluetooth driver will generate DEBUGCHK breaks (2 to 3 times) when using a 
    debug build with kernel debugger. Pressing the F5 key (Debug Menu / 'Start')
    to continue running will properly boot the device. "Unknown: DEBUGCHK failed
    in file C:\ymzki\private\winceos\comm\bluetooth\pan\.\miniport.cxx at line 
    5594"
   (Jira # OMAP3WCE600-59)

--) UFSDIO/SDHC driver may generate DEBUGCHK breaks (~10 times) when using a 
    debug build with kernel debugger. Pressing the F5 key (Debug Menu / 'Start')
    to continue running may help, a reboot may be required. "Unknown: DEBUGCHK 
    failed in file C:\WINCE600\PLATFORM\LOGIC_SOM_OMAP35x\SRC\drivers\sdhc\
    SDBUS2\sddevice.cpp"
   (Jira # OMAP3WCE600-450)

--) USB OTG Host functionality requires adding the following items to the OS 
    build: 
      - USB OTG Function
      - USB Function
      - USB Function Client
   (Jira # OMAP3WCE600-451)

--) USB OTG may disconnect from USB Host or USB Devices.
   (Jira # OMAP3WCE600-91)

--) USB mass storage devices connected to the USB Host interface unexpectedly 
    terminate during read transactions. This issue does not exist when 
    connecting a USB mass storage device to the USB OTG interface.
   (Jira # OMAP3WCE600-452)

--) Charge current is set to 1.2A; the limit for the DM3730 Torpedo Development 
    kit is 0.6A (at room temperature less than 30C). To change the charging current, 
    comment the following code from the \WINCE600\PLATFORM\LOGIC_SOM_OMAP35x\SRC\
    oal\oallib\oem_pm.c file:

   // UPDATE MAIN BATTERY CHARGING SETTINGS ON TORPEDO PLATFORM
   {
      OALTritonWrite(hTwl, TWL_BOOT_BCI, 0x10); //need to turn off auto-charging
      OALTritonWrite(hTwl, TWL_BCICTL1, 0x20); //update charging current to 2x
      OALTritonWrite(hTwl, TWL_BOOT_BCI, 0x11); //turn back on auto-charging

   // OALTritonWrite(hTwl, TWL_BCIMFKEY, 0xE7);

6) How To
---------
--) How to enable debug messages
    By default, debug messages get disabled at the end of kernel initialization.
    The rationale for disabling the debug messages is to avoid conflicts between
    the debug messages and the user-level UART driver as they use the same 
    physical UART port. In order to enable the debug messages, select the 
    DM37x SOM-LV Debug serial option found in the following catalog path
    Third Party\BSP\LOGIC_ARM_A8\Device Drivers\Serial\UART\UART1

    When the debug serial option is enabled, the use of the COM1 UART driver 
    will not be available. The other serial ports are available when receiving 
    debug messages through the debug serial port.

    NOTE: The recommended method for debug is using KITL.
        
--) How to enable KITL
    - Open Project > LOGIC_SOM_ARM_A8 properties window.
    - Select active configuration from drop-down menu.
    - Under Configuration Properties > Build Options: 
        - check "Enable Kernel debugger"
        - check "Enable KITL"
    - Under Configuration Properties > Environment:
        - set environment variable "bsp_share_eth" to 1

--) How to disable KITL
    - Open Project > LOGIC_SOM_ARM_A8 properties window.
    - Select active configuration from drop-down menu.
    - Under Configuration Properties > Build Options:
        - uncheck "Enable Kernel debugger"
        - uncheck "Enable KITL"
    - Under Configuration Properties > Environment:
        - set environment variable "bsp_share_eth" to 0

--) How to shorten the delay between removing a storage device and seeing the 
   icon disappear in Internet Explorer window
    - Adjust the following registry entries in platform.reg. The values shown 
      here are recommended values only.
        [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\StorageManager]
            "PNPUnloadDelay"=dword:3E8    ; 0.5s - default: dword:1000 (4096ms)
            "PNPWaitIODelay"=dword:1F4    ; 1.0s - default: dword:1000 (4096ms)

--) How to set hive registry
    - The OS Designs included in this BSP use RAM registry. The hive registry 
      component can be selected for custom development. Along with switching to
      the hive registry component (requires a Rebuild Solution, i.e., Clean 
      Sysgen), select where the hive is placed using the variables below.

    - Hive-based registry can be set using BSP Variables. The default variable 
      set is 'BSP_HIVE_YAFFS=1',which will set the proper registry entries for 
      placing the hive on the YAFFS partition in NAND. For use on an SD card, 
      set 'BSP_HIVE_SDHC=1' and the others to nothing.
            
      YAFFS HIVE (default if Hive used)
        In LOGIC_ARM_A8.bat
           set BSP_HIVE_YAFFS=1
           set BSP_HIVE_SDHC=
           set BSP_HIVE_ATAMEMCF=

      SD CARD HIVE
        In LOGIC_ARM_A8.bat
           set BSP_HIVE_YAFFS=
           set BSP_HIVE_SDHC=1
           set BSP_HIVE_ATAMEMCF=
      
    - Perform a Rebuild Solution (i.e., Clean Sysgen) when changing between 
      RAM-based and Hive-based registries.
   
--) How to build when changing bewteen platforms (Torpedo vs SOM-LV)
    - The BSP can support two platforms: DM3730/AM3703 Torpedo SOM or 
      DM3730/AM3703 SOM-LV. The platform can be selected in 
      Catalog Items View > Third Party > BSP > 
      LOGIC_ARM_A8: ARM4VI > Platform Support (choose one) > DM37X 
      SOM-LV or DM37X Torpedo.
      
    - Note that changing the platform requires a Clean Sysgen. This can be 
      accomplished using one of the following options:
        - Solution Explorer > LOGIC_ARM_A8 > C:/WINCE600 > Platform > 
          LOGIC_ARM_A8 (right-mouse-clik menu) > Rebuild
        - Menu > Build > Rebuild Solution
        - Menu > Build > Advance Build Commands > Clean Sysgen
        - Menu > Build > Advance Build Commands > Rebuild Current BSP and 
          Subprojects
